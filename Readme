data: Contains all the data
I didn't add this directory to git repository because it's too large.
It has been put in Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/35kdqg2fst4cosm/AAD_Zw0CGLVTJS5fz-DCR3b4a?dl=0

Step 1: run-rnaview.py
Run RNAView to parse all the RNA pdb files.

Step 2: get-ss.py
Get RNA secondary from RNAView outputs.
An example of the secondary file is 'data/4K27.ss'.

Step 3: decompose-ss.py
Decompose RNA secondary structure.
An example of the output is 'data/records'.

Step 4: decompose-pdb.py
Decompose RNA pdb files according to secondary structure decomposition output.
An example of the output is 'data/loops'.

Step 5: get-network.py
Get the networks of all the loops according to RNAView outputs.

Step 6: compare-network.py
Compare two networks.

Step 7: classify-motifs.py
Classify all the loops based on the network comparing algorithm.

Step 8: analyze-motifs.py
Analyze all the motifs.

data: Contains all the data
I didn't add this directory to git repository because it's too large.
It has been put in Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/35kdqg2fst4cosm/AAD_Zw0CGLVTJS5fz-DCR3b4a?dl=0

Step 1: run_rnaview.py
Run RNAView to parse all the RNA pdb files.

Step 2: get_ss.py
Get RNA secondary from RNAView outputs.
An example of the secondary file is 'data/4K27.ss'.

Step 3: decompose_ss.py
Decompose RNA secondary structure.
An example of the output is 'data/records'.

Usage:

    python decompose_ss2.py -ss "$(cat aa.ss)"

Step 4: decompose_pdb.py
Decompose RNA pdb files according to secondary structure decomposition output.
An example of the output is 'data/loops'.

Usage:

    python decompose_pdb.py -pdb aa.pdb -ghp aa.ghp

Step 5: get_network.py
Get the networks of all the loops according to RNAView outputs.

Step 6: compare_network.py
Compare two networks.

Step 7: classify_motifs.py
Classify all the loops based on the network comparing algorithm.

Step 8: analyze_motifs.py
Analyze all the motifs.
